//Write a function that takes an array of numbers.
//If the array does not have an even number of elements, return null
//If the array has an even number of elements, add every 2 elements together and store it in a new array.
//return the new array.

//Call the function with a test array (one with even number of elements and one with an odd number of elements)
//Output the result of that call to the console via console.log.

//array[index] means get the value of the array at the index (the value of the variable named index)
//array[index + 1] get the value of the array at the element to the right of the index

//When doing this, remember if you do array[index + 1] and index + 1 >= array.length, you will get an error.
//You shouldn't be dealing with that issue if you're doing it right though.
